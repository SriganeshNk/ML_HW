Ada Boost implementation:

1. Works on the data bupa.data
2. bupa.data should be on the same directory as the execution part.
3. Q1. Prints the train error and test error after every sampling.
 Plots the average train and test error in a single graph.
 Blue --- Train
 Green --- Test

4. Q2. Prints the choice of feature and the margin used for classification for the first 10 iterations, when training the entire data.

5. Q3. Calculates the cdf and plots the points at T = 10, 50 and 100.
